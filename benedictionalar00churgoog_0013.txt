1821.¹ In 1832 Mr. John Gage' appended a εει-εἰη] account of
the book and its contenta to his edition οἰ the Benedictional
of S. AEthelwold.¹ More reeently it lus been described by
M. Silvestre in his Pauographie Universellg by Μ, Pottier in
Frere's Manus! du Bthliograploe Normami, and by the late
Prosmor Westwood in his Facsimu'ks of Miniatura· and Orna-
ments in Angla-Saxam and Irislr Manusmpn. Bries notices of
it mny be found in the list of English Pnun'ficals prefixed by
the Dean os Carlisle to his edition of the Pontifical os Cardinal
Bnlnbrirlge„⁴ in the more derailed list included by Mr. W. H.
Frere in the third volume of the Αἰαίη Club Cvllections, and in
ffb Henri Omont's Catalugue of the MSS. of the Rauen

ι rary.

The volume, which now‘ bears the press—mark Y7, is in a
modern binding os yellow leather, and contains 191 numbered
leaves, measuring npproximately 12} by 93 inc-hes* So sar ns its
original contenis are coucemed, the manuscript is a fine speci-
men of English writing aud illumination : the miniatum which
remain are only three in number; but in each case the
[θείης the miniatum is decorated with a border in gold aud
ecloum and similar borders appear in two other places where
there is now no miniature. In oue of these places (between
fol. 8 and sol, 9) there in an apparent break in the text; and
here at any rate it seems likely that a leaf has been removed:
in the uther case (between sol. 27 and sol. 28) it does not
appear that any part os the text has been lust.

The book is commonly called a ¹¹Benedictional,¹¹ but it
contains not only a Beuedictimt in the narrower sense os the
word—n collection us Episeopal benedietions for use in the
service of the Mass, such as we find as a separate volume in
the Benedictional of S. AEthelwold, or ns a part os most of the
English Pontificals—hut also a collection os Pontifical offices,
lt might, in fact, be described with equal or greater accuracy
