that the volume was intended sor the use of AEthelgar. seme
time Abbut os the New Minster, who became Bishop of Selsey
in 980. and succeeded S. Dunstan in the throne os Canterbury
in 988, seems not unlikely to be correct: but there is no direct
evidence os its truth. The provisiou of benedictions sor the
festivals os S. Grimbald and S. Juduc, which were probably not
generally observed outside the New Minster, might perhaps
suggest that the volume was intended sor use iu the New
Minster itsels, and not sor the use of a Bishop os Selsey or an
Amhhishop ef Canterburyss

ln the shorter os the two litanies mentioned above it is to
be observed that certain names are written in gold: they are
those os the Blessed Virgin Mary. S, Michael, S. Peter, S.
Bartholomew, and S. Derris. With regard to the first three os
these names, the fact of their being thus distinguished is hasdly
remarkable; but the selection os the names of S. Bastholomew
and S. Denis, in a litany where the number of saints mentioned
by name in each group is so srnall as in this particular case,
is itself rather singular, and seems, when it is emphasimd by
the distinction given to the names by the use οἰ gold, to demand
some attention.¹ It can hardly, however, suggest any decided
inserence as to the place l'or which the book was originally
intended to serve, or modisy the opinion which is formed nn
other grounds as to the place where it was written. With
regard to the name 05⁶5. Denis, it seems most likely that the

book belongs· Such increased veneration os S. Denis may not
unreasonably be connected with what we learn as to the special
devotion with which the saint was regarded by S. Edith ns
Wilten, and with the account of the vision of S. Dunstnn, aster
the death os S. Edith, in which S. Derris appeared as her
