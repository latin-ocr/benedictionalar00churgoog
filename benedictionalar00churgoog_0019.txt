it may perhaps weigh against the ideutffication os '‘Archbkhop

earlier than 1050, and that there is, as we have seen. some
ground for supposing that the book was still at Canterbury at
ι time at least thirty years aster the death of AEthelgar, when
the ffingedponfifime os Robert of Rouen was more than half

On the whole. it may be said that while the evidence os the

and it would seem that some os those who have followed the
lead ol* Abbt} Sans have been influenced by the tendency to
associate the ‘¹ Benedictional” with the Sacramentary given to

pruvieion. ln some cases their Norman character is clearly
marked: thus the order sor a Provincia! Council is clearly sor
the province ol* Rauen: the additional section relating to the
