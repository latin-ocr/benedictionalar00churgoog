amn that at which the name was inserted in the short Litauy.
But, if it were only n question os the invocation of the saint in
preference to others os the Apostolic company, the increase
οῖ his fame in connection with the relic at Croyland might
furnish one sufficient reason sor the choico, while another might
be found in the fact that the relies, and presumably also the
intercession, of the Apostle were held to he os special efficacy
as a protectior-r against lightning,¹—a belief which might very
naturally have led to his being specially invoked at the dedica-
tion os a new building. lt is less easy to account for the later
insertion of his nar-ne¹ apart srorn local considerations of some
special kind.

Such local reasons, it would seem, were to be found at
Canterhury, at a time somewhat later than that to which the
main body os the MS. has been assigned. It was in the time of
the Archbishop AEthelnoth (iz. aster 10¹9), and apparently before
the death of Canute (rxth November, 1035), that the Queen
Emma gave to Christ Church, Canterbury, che arm os S. Bar-
tholomew, which she purchased from a Bishop of Benevento.⁵
Is the addition os the saint's name was rnade at Canterhury.
aster the acquisition os this relic. the insertion and the decern-
tion os the name seem to be sufficiently explained. On this
hypothesis, the MS. must have remained in England at least
until the year 1020,—a point which, though it is sar from being
certain, ought perhaps to be taken into account in considering
the question οἱ its ownership.

This question has been the subject of a good deal of dis-
cussion. That the book was at some time the property os nn
Archbishop named Robert seems to be generally admitted;
hut there is a doubt whether the possessor was Robert os
Jumstges, the Non-man Archbishop of Cantabury, who was
dn'ven from his sce in 1052 and died at Jumieges in 1070¹ or
Robert of Normandy, Archbishop os Rouen from 990 to 1037.

On the recto os sol. 1 a hand, probably not earlier than the
seventcenth century, has written the title¹ “Benedictionarius
Roberti Archiepiscopi.¹¹ Arrer these words, something appears
to have been erased. The Abbc Saas, in the eighteenth
century, supplied the word ''Cantuariensis.'' Dnm TassinA in
